                <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl">Hello and thank you for your interest in my studio.</p><br />
                <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl">I am a maker at heart. Creating rooms and spaces were always my way so it's no surprise that I ended up in the Interior Design program at Iowa State University. Little did I know at the time, it would start me on a path that would lead me to finding my niche of hands-on creative work through sewing, furniture upholstery and detailed accents. I love that every job is different in almost every aspect... style, construction, design elements and I am always learning a new skill.</p><br />
                <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl">In 2012 I started Three Story Studio after taking several years of upholstery classes at my nearby community college. Since then, I have continued to hone my skillset into a variety of types and sizes of projects. The people I have the pleasure of working with on a continual basis are just another reason I feel thankful for what I do.</p><br />
                <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl">If given the opportunity, I will always treat the pieces that hold your memories (past and future) with the same thoughtfulness and care I give my own.</p><br />
                <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl">Outside the studio you can most likely find me in my garden, on a lake kayaking, baking sourdough bread, reading historical fiction books or driving around visiting all my favorite people.</p>
